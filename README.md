# Space Invaders for Mindstorms NXT
For the final project of APSC 142 (Intro to Programming for Engineers), a clone of space invaders was implemented for the Lego Mindstorms NXT series of robots. The following items are prerequisites:

- Lego Mindstorms NXT base with RobotC installed. EV3 robots are similar enough that they should work with a small amount of code adaptation.
- Lego motor with a position sensor. The position sensor inside the NXT motor is used to control the position of the ray gun. EV3 motors will work, however you will need to add a call to unlock the motor to spin freely.
- 2 Bumpers/Touch sensors. One is used to select difficulty, the other is a start/fire button.
